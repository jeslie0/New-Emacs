#+title: New Emacs
#+author: James Leslie

This is the result of me declaring Emacs bankruptcy, and needing a more modular configuration for use at home and work. To use it, add the desired modules to the modules.el list and run =compileModules=. This generates the init.el from the selected modules. Add user configuration to =config.el=, not =init.el=, otherwise it will be overwritten when compile-modules is run.

I will probably change the name of this repository, when I come up a better name!

* Tips
** Package managing
I use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] for configuration and [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] as a package manager.
** Keybindings
I use [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] for most of the keybindings.
